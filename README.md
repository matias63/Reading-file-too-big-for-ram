disease.py uses the file cardio_train.csv

PythonApplication1.py uses evals.csv (the big file)

I mostly worked in disease becasue the data was more manageable than the chess piece data used in the pythonApplication1.
its iinly focus was to see what happened with too large files to store. 

disease have some notes to the focus area of the program, but i will add them here aswell.
### Focus: Using the generator to not store any data in memory from the dataset.
### Using Composition to make single responsibility functions
### Calculate the fitness of people in the dataset based on their MET score without storing any of the read data in memory.
